        <div class="center-div">
            <p>The months after the February Revolution was a period of splintering change in the relationship between workers and soldiers in Petrograd. 
                The revolution itself was a unifying force in which soldiers and workers generally allied in a single cause, to take down the Tsarist government. 
                The months after the revolution led to splits between individual army regiments and individual factories. Each of these groups of workers and 
                soldiers had differing relationships with one another ranging from praising their unity to violence in the streets. This period demonstrates 
                a time where workers and soldiers had the freedom to interact directly with one another without an external force like the Okhrana, or secret 
                police, filtering information. This means that the masses could show their own agency, not a political party, which resulted in a complex, 
                diverse relationship between the masses that was changing rapidly as recorded by literate workers and soldiers themselves.</p>

            <p>The relationship between the workers and soldiers before the revolution was generally marked with contention in the broadest view going back decades. 
                There had been several rebellions by the peasantry and the new emerging working class against the government, each of these rebellions put down by 
                soldiers loyal to the Tsarist government. One of the most well-known examples of this was the 1905 Revolution in which workers took to the streets 
                and protested against the government. The result of this was that the soldiers who remained loyal to the government put down the rebellion 
                violently such as in massacres such as Bloody Sunday. For the Tsarist government, soldiers were the tool to putting down worker and peasant rebellions.</p>

            <p>During the February Revolution of 1917, women workers in particular began demonstrations against the tsarist government, some arguing that they had given 
                up their sons, husbands, and food for the war. The government was stripping away everything they needed to sustain themselves. This wasn’t new as women 
                had been saying things such as, “No bread, no meat, no sugar, no anything,” a peasant woman said, for well over a year before the revolution began. 
                This sentiment towards the war for women was nothing new, but these unfulfilled demands exploded into revolution on International Women’s Day in 1917. 
                A male metal worker recounter women in the alleys of factories shouting, “Come out! Stop work!’ Snowballs pelted the windows. We decided to join the 
                demonstration,” on the first morning of the revolution. About 87,000 workers struck on February 23rd of the Orthodox calendar, demanding bread according 
                to Chief of Section, Major General of the Okhrana. The sentiment was clear from the mass demonstrations that the workers were once again in opposition to 
                the government.</p>

            <p>The garrisoned soldiers in Petrograd were once again placed in a position to respond to the demonstrations but unlike earlier revolutions, the soldiers sided 
                with the workers, not remaining loyal to the government. Workers and soldiers at the point of the February Revolution were in the same revolutionary faction 
                which was a turning point in their relationship. One such demonstration of this was on February 26th when a Cossack officer was reportedly fired at by an 
                inspector for not following orders and the Cossack officer returned fire and killed the inspector.</p>

            <p>Support for the demonstrations turned violent as Cossacks and soldiers turned their weapons on the loyalists. Another such example was the soldiers from the 
                Volynskii Regiment killing their officers and provided weapons to workers in Petrograd. The soldiers siding with and arming the workers meant that the 
                government couldn’t hold onto power since the main method of the government putting down demonstrations, soldiers firing on the peasants and workers, was 
                out of the picture. The masses formed a cooperative relationship that caused the collapse of the government.</p>

            <p>In the immediate aftermath of the February Revolution, this largely cooperative relationship continued. Workers for example could be seen honoring fallen soldiers. 
                One such worker was a metalworker named Demian Semyonov in the Smolensk Province who in March dedicated a poem to fallen soldiers. In it, he states that 
                the soldiers had sacrificed their blood for the workers’ sacred freedom. The soldiers were said to have unlocked the prisons and threw the tyrant’s yoke and 
                allowed the dawn of freedom to break. This honoring of the soldiers expresses that the relationship between workers and soldiers was symbiotic. For Semyonov, 
                this relationship was necessary for the Tsarist government to be taken down as it is the soldiers who sacrificed their blood for the workers, thus soldiers had 
                the means to achieve the revolution whereas workers couldn’t have alone. This view displays that the workers and soldiers needed one another during this 
                revolutionary period.</p>

            <p>The relationship between workers and soldiers wasn’t so symbiotic everywhere. In late March, tension between workers and soldiers at other factories was building 
                as their relationship was being questioned in response to news from the press. The People’s Cause, a Petrograd Socialist Revolutionary newspaper, reported that 
                workers from the Lebedev Plant were refusing to work. This was an armament factory producing equipment for the war effort. Hearing that the workers were refusing 
                to work at this factory especially was concerning for some soldiers of the Izamailovskii Regiment National Guard Reserve Battalion who would send delegates to the 
                factory to check on the workers. This moment demonstrates that the relationship between workers and soldiers wasn’t so idealistic as Semyonov portrays and that 
                other groups of workers and other groups of soldiers didn’t trust each other as much.</p>

            <p>The workers of the Lebedev Plant and the Izamailovskii Regiment each replied to The People’s Cause in letters after the delegates from the soldiers had met the 
                workers. For the factory, their letter responded, “We Lebedev Plant workers indignantly protest the dreadful allegations against us. We protest the against 
                malevolent people who want to sow enmity between comrade workers and soldiers.”  Despite the sudden rise of tension between the workers of this factory and the 
                soldiers of the Izamailovskii Regiment, there was a call for unity first and foremost. The workers of the factory argue that the allegations against them, that 
                they were refusing to work, was false. The allegations instead are said to appear to be an attempt of unnamed entities trying to break the relationship between 
                workers and soldiers. These unnamed entities aren’t shown to be anyone or any organization in particular. This does show us that the unnamed entities were an 
                external force. This is critical because the workers are pointing to the press that an outside organization doesn’t like this strong relationship between workers 
                and soldiers, whoever that organization may be. This letter shows that even as the tension was rising, workers at this plant and soldiers of this regiment were 
                calling for unity and argued for using their agency to maintain this relationship even as external forces are attempting to break it up.</p>

            <p>For the soldiers of the Izamailovskii Regiment, they also replied to The People’s Cause in a letter after their delegates returned from their inspection. In their 
                letter, they state: “It’s true that not everything is straightened out. It’s true that you will hear the cries, ‘there are no materials! There is no coal!” 
                This displays that the work being halted was true and that work wasn’t always getting done. However, the blame was not pinned on the workers unlike what 
                The People’s Cause was claiming. “The workers all want work, not to hinder work. Our delegates saw entire mountains of artillery shells, entire mountains of 
                awesome weapons.” The workers are addressed as wanting to continue work and were on the same side as the soldiers, wanting to support the war effort by 
                producing equipment whenever they can but simply lack the materials to be as efficient as they can be. The blame doesn’t rest with the workers, instead, 
                it rested with a lack of raw materials. The importance is that the soldiers established that the workers were still trustworthy in spite of the allegations 
                of the press. The soldiers are also arguing for unity with the workers before trusting external forces that may not have this relationship as a goal. 
                For this instance, the report on workers was the source of turbulence between the workers and soldiers of these organizations.</p>

            <p>Up to this point, the relationship between workers and soldiers had gone from contentious before the revolution under the Tsarist government to symbiotic 
                during the revolution in a combined call for deposing the government. It’s important to note that the workers had originally began the revolution demanding 
                food and an end to the war and after the revolution, the zeal of the revolution reinvigorated the fighting effort as the soldiers of the Izamailovskii 
                Regiment and the workers of the Lebedev Plant together were in favor of the war. This shows that even as tension rose between workers and soldiers, they 
                can still have the same goals in mind and that the goal can change with the circumstances around them. A major take away from these experiences so far were 
                that the workers and soldiers were demonstrating their own agency as they were seeking out what their relationship should be for themselves and questioning 
                the motives of external entities trying to influence this relationship.</p>

            <p>In April, another instance of tension between workers and soldiers was building, this time indirectly. Prisons had inmates released by soldiers which contributed 
                to rising crime in the months after the revolution. The result of this increased crime was the rise of worker militias to combat the crime. Workers were responding 
                to the predicament some soldiers had created with “mob justice” which was worker militias defending their residences. The actions of the soldiers led to 
                hostile conditions for workers that the workers delt with by forming Red Guards. This is an example of soldiers causing turbulence in their relationship with 
                workers in the districts affected most from these prison releases though it’s important to note that some Red Guards as seen with the figure above had soldiers 
                mixed into their guards as well which also shows the complexity of the situation.</p>

            <p>This relationship between workers and soldiers descended further during the July Crisis. This was an incident in which workers spontaneously took to the streets 
                on July 3rd to protest the war. Many of these workers were gunned down by soldiers loyal to the Provisional Government that were following orders to disperse 
                the crowd violently. The Bolsheviks would claim, “Indecent shootings by counterrevolutionaries could not distract from the demonstration’s general character.” 
                The Bolsheviks paint the soldiers loyal to the Provisional Government negatively as oppositional to the revolution. It’s important to note that the Bolsheviks 
                played a part in the strife of the July Crisis, but these demonstrations were spontaneous. The actions taken between the workers and the soldiers was determined 
                by the workers and the soldiers deciding to follow order, not an outside faction like a political party such as the Bolsheviks or Socialist Revolutionaries. 
                This again shows that the workers and soldiers had their own agency during this time between the February and October revolutions. The moment of the July 
                Crisis represented previous patterns in which workers would strike in the streets and soldiers respond to put down the revolt. In this respect, the relationship 
                between the workers and soldiers in this moment was reminiscent of their relationship during the Tsarist government, the most disconnected the workers and 
                soldiers could have been from one another.</p>

            <p>Even as these soldiers and workers held a violent relationship, other workers and soldiers the following day stood in solidarity with one another as seen at 
                the gunpowder workers and First Reserve Infantry Regimental Committee. “We 5,000 male and female workers and soldiers at the Shlissel’burg gunpowder plant, 
                having discussed the 3 July events in Petrograd, greet and support the comrade Petrograd soldiers and workers who have protested in the struggle against 
                counter revolutionaries.” This show of support for the protests among soldiers and workers at this plant displays a strong relationship between these 
                military units and factories even as the relationship deteriorated for other factories and other units. Another aspect to note is that the soldiers said 
                to be at this factory during the crisis supported the demonstrations, meaning they were in opposition to the soldiers of the July Crisis. The soldiers of 
                these two regiments disagreed with one another which further shows that the soldiers didn’t always agree with one another. This shows that regiments had 
                differing levels of allegiance to workers.</p>

            <p>This relationship between the workers and soldiers at the July Crisis was much more like the relationship they had before the February Revolution. This was 
                a very different relationship from the tense but still united stance against external forces like with the Izamailovskii Regiment and the Lebedev Plant; a 
                very different relationship from the symbiotic relationship between the Volynskii Regiment and workers like Demian Semyonov fighting together against the 
                Petrograd Police; and a very different relationship from the Red Guard defending the streets from criminals the soldiers inadvertently released during the 
                revolution. The relationship between the soldiers and workers in the July Crisis was exactly the type of relationship that sparked revolutionary desire in 
                the masses. This relationship represented soldiers being used by an oppressive external force to hinder the desire of the masses. Even during this moment 
                of strife, other soldiers and other workers as seen with the Shlissel’burg gunpowder plant stood together. The relationship’s biggest turn so far after the 
                February Revolution was that the individual regiments and factories had splintered into various responses. There was no longer one large unifying view 
                that appeared to have united the majority of workers and soldiers as seen with the revolution’s goal of deposing the Tsar and ending the war.</p>

            <p>The relationship between the soldiers and workers who were at the July Crisis appeared to be a relapse back to the status quo before the revolution, 
                but a major difference is the calls for unity from outside forces that complemented the calls for unity among the workers and soldiers themselves mentioned above. 
                Only two days after the July Crisis, on July 5th, the Petrograd Socialist Revolutionary’s Committee called for the relationship between workers and soldiers 
                to be repaired. “Enough demonstrations! Enough wild unrest! Enough senseless parading the streets! Enough spilling of fraternal blood! The revolution needs the 
                disciplined and solid unity of all workers and soldiers in Petrograd.” Even during a moment of upheaval in the relationship between workers and soldiers, 
                shown with the killings, the harshest the relationship can be, there was simultaneous calls for unity. This unity was to be enforced much like with how 
                the Izamailovskii Regiment contacted the Lebedev Plant. “All district committees must establish contact with the factories and military units and keep 
                uninterrupted watch,” with explicit instructions for these decrees to be read aloud to all workers and soldiers at all party and general assemblies. 
                The goal of this instruction appears to be to maintain direct contact between workers and soldiers, so their alliance is maintained. This appears to be 
                directly aimed at preventing soldiers and workers from firing on one another again because of some outside force directing them such as the Provisional 
                Government. This appears to be a recognition of the symbiotic relationship that Demian Semyonov was pointing to, that the workers and soldiers need 
                one another with actions to ensure the workers and soldiers continue to cooperate under the watch of the Socialist Revolutionary Party.</p>

            <p>The Socialist Revolutionaries weren’t the only party attempting to rally the soldiers and workers together. The Bolsheviks as well were attempting to 
                rally the workers and soldiers under their party within a month of the July Crisis. “Our party, the party of the revolutionary proletariat, is running 
                as list no. 6 in the 20 August election to the Central City Duma. Every worker, peasant, and soldier must cast their vote for this list only.” The 
                Bolsheviks were claiming to be the sole representatives of peasants, workers, and soldiers and addressed them as a single faction, implying that these 
                classes must be united.</p>

            <p>The Socialist Revolutionaries and the Bolsheviks represent external forces recognizing the soldiers and workers as a single faction that is vital to the 
                goals of the parties. The soldiers and workers together took down the Tsarist government with their own agency. External forces thought to be attempting to 
                break the relationship between soldiers and workers as seen in The People’s Cause actually sparked a strengthening of the soldiers and workers of their own 
                will. The political parties attempting to rally the workers and soldiers together most likely know that the worker-soldier unity is a source of power that 
                will give the ruling party the authority to shape Russia.</p>

            <p>The external parties sought to unite all workers and soldiers, under each of their factions so that they can have the power of the masses that took down the 
                Tsarist government under their own party, but the reality of the situation was that workers and soldiers expressed their own agency to spontaneously take 
                down the Tsarist government together. Soldiers of the Volynskii Regiment killed their officers of their own accord and joined the very beginning of the 
                revolution during the calls to end the war. Workers like Demian Semyonov praised the soldiers for joining the revolution and emphasized how necessary 
                they were for the revolution to take place. The Lebedev Plant workers and Izamailovskii Regiment expressed initial mistrust of each other but called 
                for unity and to not listen to external forces. The soldiers of the July Crisis listened to the external force, the Provisional Government, and put down 
                the worker demonstrations in a similar vain to the Tsars in years prior. This is all the complexity of the relationship the workers and soldiers held 
                between one another that the parties were attempting to tame.</p>

            <p>The workers and soldiers had their own agency, acted independently of the parties, and held various views such as how the Volynskii Regiment were opposed 
                to the war while the Izamailovskii Regiment and Lebedev Plant were in favor of the war. Rallying all of the soldiers and all of the workers under the 
                influence of an external force such as these parties was a seemingly impossible task. The workers and soldiers held diverse views and were united and 
                opposed to one another simultaneously depending on the regiment and the factory or district in question. Most importantly, the workers and soldiers were 
                the ones with power to take down the Tsarist government of their own agency without an external force and even warned against believing external forces 
                trying to influence their relationship. The parties rallying the workers and soldiers went against how the revolution began. This complexity in Petrograd 
                alone points to the vast complexity that may have been seen in the rest of Russia.</p>

            <p>The relationship between workers and soldiers in Petrograd in the months after the February Revolution shifted from one of contention before the revolution, 
                to a symbiotic relationship in the month of the revolution, to a much more nuanced relationship that was tense, violent, appreciative, hopeful, and very 
                mixed depending on the exact regiment and the exact factory or district in question. The general direction of the relationship in short was that it began 
                with a single overall goal of taking down the Tsarist regime and achieving long awaited volia and ended up divisive and splintered before the October Revolution.</p>
