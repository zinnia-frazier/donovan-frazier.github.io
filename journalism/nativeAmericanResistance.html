        <h1 class="center-div" style="padding-top:75px;">Caught Between Power Blocs</h1>

        <div class="center-div">

        <div class="center-div">

            <p>In Eastern North America, there were two major power blocs forming in the 1700s. Along the eastern coast, there were the colonists of 
                various European empires such as the British, Dutch, and Spanish. To the west of them was the Iroquois, six tribal nations that were a 
                united front against the expansion of the European colonists. In the middle were several of the tribal nations we have discussed in the 
                class so far. These peoples in the middle often had more difficulty mounting successful resistance to the colonists because of three 
                main obstacles which were political divisions, size, and the number of different colonists they were opposing, but there were a couple 
                factors that helped with resistance.</p>

            <p>The first obstacle for these middle indigenous people was the political divisions within the tribal nations. Unlike the Yaquis or Pueblo 
                peoples who had united their individual tribal nations in the far west, the middle indigenous people to the east at times faced much heavier 
                difficulties uniting. One such example was the seven Cherokee clans in which resistance against the British was hampered by blame for failures 
                being shifted around the various clans. This demonstrated that even though the Cherokee were seen as a single people, the Cherokee themselves 
                didn’t necessarily act in unity. This could also be observed with the Chickamauga Cherokee splitting off into their own separate faction in the 
                years following the Seven Years’ War with many of their people migrating out because of disagreements with the change in leadership. Splits such 
                as these would cause the tribal nation to shrink, making forming a unified resistance against the colonists even more difficult than it already was. </p>

            <p>A second obstacle for these middle indigenous people was the size of their tribal nations. There were examples of tribal nations being too large to 
                coordinate effective resistance as well as being too small to do so. One such example was that the Cherokee peoples were so large or spread out enough 
                that Cherokee people in different regions spoke different languages. This would make relaying information for coordinating a unified resistance difficult. 
                On the other end of the spectrum, tribal nations such as the Mohegan and Pequot in New England were outnumbered by the colonists at the time of King Philip’s War. 
                Being outnumbered outside of being the cause of fears of the colonist to begin with, was also a militaristic disadvantage that made armed resistance difficult. </p>

            <p>A third obstacle was the different colonists in the area forming a single bloc of power as seen with the various New England colonies. These colonies 
                were originally separate but shortly before King Philip’s War, formed a unified power bloc at the Plymouth War Council. The united colonists in 
                the northeast formed an effective offensive against the indigenous tribal nations caught between the two blocs. Not only this, but there were also 
                the Spanish to the southwest and the French to the northwest. If this information was placed on a map, it would appear that the European 
                colonists were encircling the middle indigenous people which would have been quite alarming if word traveled across the many different languages. 
                The unity of the colonists as a single power bloc in places such as New England meant that divisions within tribal nations put the tribal nations 
                at a severe disadvantage since the tribal nations would have internal struggles to deal with on top of the external conflicts like disease and 
                colonial expansion. </p>

            <p>In spite of these obstacles, there were also factors that helped the indigenous people resist the colonists. One factor was that non-combatants served 
                an immensely important role in holding the society together. An example of this was seen in praying towns being used as refuge in the aftermath of 
                King Philip’s War. These towns helped survivors collect together in a safe place which held the society in place instead of complete collapse. The tribal 
                nations were still persisting after offensives by the colonists. Another example was the maintenance of culture under women such as Cockacoeske that held 
                the spiritual and cultural fabric of the society together in spite of massive losses from war and the deaths of leaders. The fabric being held together 
                was a sign that the society was still resisting even in the aftermath of a defeat during war.</p>

            <p>One more factor that helped the middle indigenous people was intratribal cooperation. This was seen with the divided New England tribal nations coming 
                together for a unified response against the expanding British as seen with economic unity in blocking land sales to the colonists. This form of 
                resistance was effective, but the Iroquois would be the most effective at using their united power bloc to broker peace on behalf of surrounding 
                indigenous peoples. They used their politics to successfully prevent war with the expanding British before the Seven Years’ War and maintain their 
                resistance to colonialism. </p>

            <p>As seen, there were a variety of factors that hindered resistance movements of indigenous peoples caught between the main two power blocs in 
                Eastern North America as well as some factors that helped resistance movements. Middle peoples such as the Cherokee, Mohegan, and Pequot were the 
                least unified and struggled the most to mount resistance against colonialism because of it. But other indigenous power blocs that were more centralized 
                such as the Iroquois or faced smaller colonial forces such as the Yaquis in the west faired much better. The people caught between the power blocs 
                suffered the most from direct conflict and weaker resistance to the colonists. </p>
